# 000078 — differential reduction & reassembly (strain-compat gap-D core)

Continues vibe 000077.  The operator foundation gives us `inc ε = ∇×(∇×ε)ᵀ`
built with ε **abstract** and ∇ expanded:

    inc ε = Σ_{a,b} u_a × (u_b × ∂_a∂_b ε)ᵀ          (WCS, ε never componentised)

but it stops there — the nested cross of concrete frame vectors with an
*abstract* rank-2 `∂_a∂_b ε` cannot reduce, and there is no way to fold the
result back into the named invariant operators.  This vibe designs the two
missing phases that carry it to the closed identity

    inc ε = −∇∇θ + Δθ·I − (∇∇··ε)I − Δε + 2(∇∇·ε)ˢ ,   θ = tr ε.

## The two phases

- **Reduction (Phase 1).**  Turn the cross structure `e_i × (e_j × ε)ᵀ` into a
  sum of dyad / dot / trace terms via the `a×B×c` identity — with the frame
  vectors *free-indexed* and ε abstract.
- **Reassembly (Phase 2).**  Fold `Σ … e_i ∂_i … ε` back into the invariant
  operators, by reading, for each ∂, the *role* of its index.  This is the novel
  engine: the differential analogue of `reassemble` (basis.hpp), which already
  folds `Σ_i a_i e_i → a` for the non-differential case.

## Representation — settled by prior decisions, now grounded

Two decisions the user already made (the very first design fork of gap D) come
back into force, now that the operator foundation exists:

1. **Abstract implicit-summation index** (not the concrete 9-pair expansion).
   The identity fires **once** on `e_i × (e_j × ε)ᵀ` with `i,j` summed, and — the
   decisive reason — reassembly then just *reads the index contractions*
   (frame-free vs contracted-with-ε vs δ-contracted), which is frame-independent
   and clean.  The concrete path would need fragile 9-term cycle recognition.
2. **A chart-free ∇ operator** as the invariant representation.  This is *not* the
   fused `Del{grad/div/rot}` we retired — it is the bare **rank-1 ∇ operator**
   (the "∇ is a rank-1 vector operator" decision), with grad/div/rot = ∇ combined
   with `⊗`/`·`/`×`.  It serves three roles at once: the natural chart-free way to
   *write* `inc ε = ∇×(∇×ε)ᵀ`, the thing that *expands* to `Σ_i e_i ∂_i` in a
   chart, and the *reassembly target* (∇∇θ, Δε, … as `Nabla`-operator Exprs).

## The pieces

### A. Chart-free ∇ operator (`Nabla` node)

A rank-1 invariant operator atom, operator-aware exactly like `Deriv` (canon
keeps it positional; it acts rightward).  `∇⊗T`, `∇·T`, `∇×T` are the ordinary
product nodes with `Nabla` on the left.  Renders `\nabla`; `∇·∇` renders `Δ`.
Reuses all the operator-aware infrastructure of steps A–C.  `inc ε` becomes
chart-free: `Nabla × (Nabla × ε)ᵀ`.

### B. Free-index ∂ and ∇-expansion in a chart

The one genuinely new expr-model capability, and the reason `DerivMark::link`
exists: a derivative whose **direction is a summation index**, tied to a frame
vector.

- `DerivMark` gains an abstract-index direction: `link != 0` means "the ∂
  direction is the `CountableIndex` with this id" (rather than the concrete
  `wrt`), so `e_i` (a frame vector carrying index `i`) and `∂_i ε` (ε with a mark
  linked to `i`) **sum together** under the existing Einstein machinery.
- `expand_nabla(chart, e)` rewrites each `Nabla` → `e_i (1/h_i) ∂_i` with a fresh
  shared index `i`: an indexed frame vector `e_i` (basis direction with a
  `CountableIndex` slot) times a free-index `∂_i`.  In a constant frame (WCS)
  `∂_i e_j = 0`, so applying the operators leaves `e_i × (e_j × ∂_i∂_j ε)ᵀ`, the
  free-index interior.
- Summation detection, canon, and render learn the abstract-index mark (it is an
  index occurrence; it renders `∂_i` with the index letter).

### C. Phase-1 reduction — the a×B×c identity, once

Apply `a×(c×B)ᵀ → …` to the free-index interior `e_i × (e_j × ε)ᵀ` (a=e_i,
c=e_j, B=ε).  Using vibe 000075's *sign-corrected* form and the 5-term
expansion, this yields (schematically, i,j summed, ∂_i∂_j riding along):

    θ(e_j⊗e_i − δ_ij I) + (e_i e_j··ε)I + δ_ij ε − e_j⊗(e_i·ε) − (e_i⊗e_j·ε)ᵀ

Mechanism: express the identity as a tender `Identity` and fire `apply_identity`
on the cross-with-rank-2 pattern (binding a,c to the free frame vectors, B to ε),
or extend the vibe-000063 cross-removal engine.  **Open:** which — a declared
Identity vs. a dedicated reducer (the LHS has a transpose inside a cross, which
stresses the matcher).

### D. Phase-2 reassembly — read each ∂'s index role  ← the heart

After Phase 1 the expression is a sum of terms, each

    coeff · [free frame vectors / δ's / I] · [∂_i∂_j (θ or ε)]     (i,j summed)

Every abstract ∂-index appears twice (Einstein): once on its ∂-mark, once as
either **(a)** a *free* frame vector `e_i`, **(b)** a `δ_ij` shared with the other
∂, or **(c)** a slot of ε (`e_i·ε`).  Reassembly classifies each ∂ by its partner
and rebuilds with `Nabla`:

| ∂-index partner | meaning | fold |
|---|---|---|
| free frame vector `e_i` (a dyad leg) | a gradient leg | `e_i ⊗ … ∂_i` → `∇ ⊗ …` |
| `δ_ij` with the other ∂ | the two ∂'s contract | `∂_i∂_i` → `∇·∇ = Δ` |
| a slot of ε (`e_i·ε`) | a divergence of ε | `(e_i·ε) ∂_i` → `∇·ε` |
| both ∂'s into ε (`ε_ij`) | double divergence | `∂_i∂_j ε_ij` → `∇∇··ε` |

So each term rebuilds to a `Nabla`-operator composition on θ or ε:

    Σ e_j⊗e_i ∂_i∂_j θ           → ∇∇θ
    Σ δ_ij ∂_i∂_j θ              → Δθ
    Σ (e_i e_j··ε) ∂_i∂_j        → ∇∇··ε
    Σ δ_ij ∂_i∂_j ε              → Δε
    Σ e_j⊗(e_i·ε) ∂_i∂_j         → ∇(∇·ε) = ∇∇·ε
    Σ (e_i⊗e_j·ε)ᵀ ∂_i∂_j        → (∇∇·ε)ᵀ

collapsing to `inc ε = −∇∇θ + Δθ·I − (∇∇··ε)I − Δε + (∇∇·ε + (∇∇·ε)ᵀ)`, i.e. the
closed identity with `2(∇∇·ε)ˢ`.  The engine is a focused walk: per term, find
the ∂-marks, resolve each index's partner, classify (grad / Laplacian /
divergence), emit the `Nabla` structure; it is the differential sibling of
`reassemble`.

## Increment plan (each buildable/testable)

1. **`Nabla` node** — chart-free rank-1 ∇ operator (build, render, operator-aware
   canon, grad/div/rot as ∇⊙, Δ = ∇·∇).  `inc ε` written chart-free.
2. **Free-index ∂ + `expand_nabla`** — abstract-index `DerivMark`; expand `Nabla`
   → `e_i ∂_i`; verify `inc ε` expands to the free-index interior with ε abstract.
3. **Phase-1 reduction** — a×B×c on the free-index interior (once), sign-corrected.
4. **Phase-2 reassembly** — the index-role engine folding to `Nabla` operators.
5. **Showcase** — `inc ε` derived as performed = the closed identity; verify vs
   the known form; then the cylindrical evaluation of the compatibility equations.

## Decisions (confirmed by the user)

- **Q1 — abstract free-index path.** ✓  Identity fires once; reassembly reads
  index roles.
- **Q2 — `DerivMark::link` as the abstract-index direction.** ✓  A
  `CountableIndex` id ties `∂_i` to `e_i` under Einstein summation.
- **Q4 — general reassembly engine.** ✓  Build the general "fold frame-indexed
  ∂-derivatives into ∇" mechanism, validated on the strain-compat patterns.
- **Q3 — derive the identities in-codebase, `a×B×c` as the sole primitive.**  Do
  *not* hand-assert or wrestle a transpose-inside-cross matcher.  Mirror
  `../tender-sandbox/identities.ipynb`: prove each identity by expanding both
  sides in WCS and self-verifying with `algebraic_eq`, then reuse via
  `apply_identity`.  The chain:
  1. Derive `id_axBxc : a×B×c = trB(c⊗a − (a·c)I) + (c·B·a)I + (a·c)Bᵀ −
     c⊗(B·a) − (c·B)⊗a`.  Recipe (from the notebook): `expand_in_basis(co)` →
     `simplify_basis_cross` → `simplify_basis_dot` → `contract_eps_pair` →
     `contract_delta` (repeat contract steps) → `reassemble`, self-verified
     against the 5-term RHS.
  2. Derive the **nested-cross helper** that turns the strain interior into
     `a×B×c` form using ε **symmetry**: the user's `a×(b×ε) = −a×ε×b` (worked out
     — with/without the outer transpose and exact sign — during derivation;
     tender catches sign slips as in vibe 000075).  So the interior
     `e_i × (e_j × ε)ᵀ` reduces first to `∓ e_i × ε × e_j`, then `id_axBxc`
     applies once.
  These derived identities live in a small library (extend `tender/identities`,
  vibe 000046) with a self-check test.

## Implementation plan (self-contained — resume here after compaction)

State at handoff: operator foundation A–E committed (vibe 000077); `inc ε`
builds with ε abstract; `DerivMark{coord_name, wrt, link}` exists with `link`
reserved.  Build these five increments, each buildable/testable, `clang-format`
+ tests green before each commit.

### Progress

- **Increment 1 DONE** (commit `cc0c54f`).  `Nabla` node added and threaded;
  grad/div/rot = ∇⊙; `inc ε = ∇×(∇×ε)ᵀ` builds chart-free; `t.nabla(ctx=…)`.
- **Increment 2 DONE** (commit `f09e3f1`).  Free-index ∂: `DerivMark` gained
  `free` (a dedicated flag — index ids can be 0, so `link != 0` won't do),
  `link` (direction id tied to e_i) and `free_slot`.  Summation counts a free
  mark; `substitute_index_ids` α-renames it with e_i; render shows ∂_i.  New
  free-index path in `diff`/`partial` via `make_coordinate_direction` wrt;
  `apply_operators` recurses into transpose/trace/vec.  `chart.expand_nabla`
  lowers `inc ε` → `e_i × (e_j × ∂_i∂_j ε)ᵀ` (i,j summed, ε abstract);
  `chart.componentize_nabla` unrolls to concrete directions.  **Verified: all 9
  components equal brute-force rot·rotᵀ.**

- **Increment 3 DONE** (commit `a83f645`).  Phase-1 cross reduction works and is
  oracle-verified.  `id_axBxc` derives via the notebook recipe to
  `a×B×c = −(a·c)trB·I + (a·Bᵀ·c)I + (a·c)Bᵀ − c⊗(B·a) − (Bᵀ·c)⊗a + trB·c⊗a`.
  The transpose-cross helper `a×(c×B)ᵀ = −a×Bᵀ×c` (and `−a×E×c` for symmetric E)
  is verified by component brute-force; composed with `id_axBxc` it gives
  `id_inc : a×(c×E)ᵀ = <cross-free δ/dyad RHS>` (correct by construction).
  Applying `id_inc` to the free-index interior `e_i×(e_j×∂_i∂_j ε)ᵀ` — ε
  abstract — yields the cross-free Phase-1 sum, **componentwise-equal to the
  brute-force interior** (increment-2 oracle).  Tests
  `test_{axbxc_identity_derives,strain_phase1_reduction}`.  **Two red herrings
  resolved:** (i) the reduction "stalled on ∂-marked expressions" was a *basis
  mismatch* in the test harness — reducing with `tb.wcs` (id 2) not the chart's
  `physical_basis()` (id 1); `simplify_basis_cross` silently no-ops on
  foreign-basis vectors (`as_basis_dir` requires a matching `basis_id`), so there
  was never a ∂-mark reduction bug; (ii) `simplify_basis_cross` needs *fixpoint
  iteration* interleaved with `canonicalize` (the transpose between crosses needs
  canon to distribute) — the "hand-tuned" quirk.  Also fixed en route: `εᵀ` did
  not fold to `ε` (commit `fb58ed7`, symmetric-transpose fold in `encapsulate`),
  which had blocked the `a×(c×ε)ᵀ` algebra.

  **The Phase-1 sum (i,j summed, ∂_i∂_j riding) and its Phase-2 targets:**
  | Phase-1 term | ∂-index roles | → operator |
  |---|---|---|
  | `−(e_i·∂∂ε)·e_j I` | both ∂ contract into ε (e_i·, ·e_j) | `−(∇∇··ε) I` |
  | `+e_i·e_j tr(∂∂ε) I` | e_i·e_j = δ_ij ⇒ Δ; trε = θ | `+Δθ·I` |
  | `−e_i·e_j ∂∂ε` | δ_ij ⇒ Δ | `−Δε` |
  | `−tr(∂∂ε) e_i⊗e_j` | e_i,e_j free legs; trε = θ | `−∇∇θ` |
  | `+e_i⊗(∂∂ε·e_j)` | e_i free (grad), e_j·ε (div) | `+∇∇·ε` |
  | `+(∂∂ε·e_j)⊗e_i` | transpose of the above | `+(∇∇·ε)ᵀ` |
  Σ = `−∇∇θ + Δθ·I − (∇∇··ε)I − Δε + 2(∇∇·ε)ˢ` — the closed identity.

- **Increment 4 (Phase-2 reassembly) DONE** (commit `8c44c15`).  `reassemble_del`
  (chart.cpp, exposed to Python) is the C++ ∂-index-role reader — Python exposes
  no `Expr` introspection.  Per additive term it drops the Σ binders, flattens
  the ⊗ factors, and classifies: a δ-pair `e_ℓ·e_m` (two direction vectors) ⇒ a
  Laplacian `Δ = ∇·(∇⊗·)`; a free frame vector ⇒ a gradient leg `∇⊗` (to the
  field's right, `(…)ᵀ`); a `·`-contracted `e_ℓ·T` ⇒ a divergence `∇·`; `tr` of
  the mark-stripped field ⇒ its scalar invariant.  Helpers `frame_dir_index`,
  `fold_divergences` (recursive div folding), `reassemble_term`.  On the strain
  interior it folds the six Phase-1 terms exactly to
  `inc ε = −∇∇θ + Δθ·I − (∇∇··ε)I − Δε + ∇∇·ε + (∇∇·ε)ᵀ`, checked by
  `algebraic_eq` against the independently-built ∇-operator identity
  (`test_strain_phase2_reassembly`).  It is the inverse of `expand_nabla` for
  single operators — `reassemble_del(expand_nabla(∇⊗ε)) = ∇⊗ε`, same for `∇·ε`
  and `∇·(∇·ε)` (C++ `ReassembleDel{RoundTripsSingleOperators,
  RecoversDoubleDivergence}`).  **Known separate limitation:** `expand_nabla(∇·∇f)`
  for a scalar `f` returns rank 2 (a div-of-grad-scalar bug in `expand_nabla`,
  not reassembly), so that shape does not round-trip; it never arises in the
  strain reduction.

**vibe 000078 COMPLETE (increments 1–5).**  `inc ε` is now derived end-to-end
"as performed" with ε abstract: expand ∇ (`expand_nabla`) → reduce the cross via
the in-codebase-derived `a×B×c` / `id_inc` identities (`apply_identity`) →
reassemble into ∇ operators (`reassemble_del`), reaching the closed
compatibility identity that increment 5 independently proved by evaluation.

- **Increment 5 DONE** (commit `8504206`), and a prerequisite operator fix
  (`7bdbf2d`).  The **closed identity is proven by tender**:

      inc ε = −∇∇θ + Δθ·I − (∇∇··ε)·I − Δε + 2(∇∇·ε)ˢ ,   θ = tr ε

  verified component-by-component against `inc ε = ∇×(∇×ε)ᵀ` in a **Cartesian
  frame and a cylindrical frame** — the curvilinear endpoint (original task #26).
  `examples/strain_compatibility.py` runs the full pipeline (chart-free inc ε →
  `expand_nabla` free-index interior with ε abstract → the stated closed form →
  componentwise verification), guarded by
  `test_strain_compatibility_closed_identity_{cartesian,cylindrical}`.  The
  verification route uses tender's mature M6 chart operators (grad/div/rot/
  laplacian) for both sides — the reassembly *engine* is not needed to *prove*
  the result, only to *produce* it automatically from the interior.
  - Prerequisite fix (`7bdbf2d`): `apply_product_operators` now applies a
    differentiated operand's own operators first (rightmost-first), so composed
    operators whose operand contains an unapplied ∇ — grad(div ε), div(div ε),
    Δε = div(grad ε) — expand instead of throwing "differentiating a ∂ operator".

- **Increments 3 & 4 — the symbolic reduce→reassemble transforms — remain
  blocked** on two distinct reduction-engine gaps (each a substantial piece of
  its own), and are *not* required for the proven result above:
  1. **Phase-1 (increment 3):** the nested transpose-cross helper
     `a×(c×B)ᵀ = −a×Bᵀ×c` leaves a residual bare `e_k×e_j` that
     `simplify_basis_cross` won't clear inside the larger product (matcher /
     reduction-ordering).  `id_axBxc` itself derives correctly.
  2. **Phase-2 (increment 4):** the reassembly engine needs Phase-1's reduced
     form as input.  Separately, componentizing the reassembly *target*
     operators through `expand_nabla` hit an `encapsulate` throw ("nested ⊗
     inside an operand awaits fence distribution", `nf_lower.cpp`).

- **`encapsulate` gap fully diagnosed (commits `f5b1f3d`, `0fe8655`) — it has
  THREE distinct root causes; the first two are now fixed, and the third turned
  out to hide a *foundational contraction-model bug*:**
  1. **Zero-fence factor — FIXED (`f5b1f3d`).**  Differentiating a constant frame
     vector (∂_i e_j = 0) leaves a literal 0 buried in a ⊗ / contraction fence,
     e.g. `e_j ⊗ (0·∂_iε)` in a componentized transposed operator result; no
     distribution removes it and `encapsulate` has no ⊗ arm.  Fix:
     `fold_forced_zeros` in `lower_term` collapses any node forced to 0 by a
     0 operand and drops additive zeros, before the all-`*` encapsulation — the
     algebraic zero law (test `CanonicalizeNf.ZeroFenceInsideContractionFolds`).
  2. **Scalar-in-contraction — FIXED (`0fe8655`).**  A concrete basis dot
     `e_a·e_a → 1` was landing as a bare `1` in a `·` chain (not the
     coefficient), which `encapsulate` cannot lower.  Root fix (user-endorsed
     invariant): a scalar has no leg to contract, so `s·T`/`s:T`/`s··T`/`s×T`
     are scalar multiplication.  `make_dot`/`make_ddot`/`make_ddot_alt`/
     `make_cross` now redirect to `make_tensor_product` when an operand is
     *known* rank 0 (unknown/abstract keeps the contraction).  `infer_rank` moved
     expr.hpp/expr.cpp so the factories can consult it without a layering
     violation.  Test `MakeBinary.ScalarOperandInContractionBecomesTensorProduct`.

- **"Cause 3" turned out to be THREE separate bugs — all now FIXED + committed:**

  - **(3b) — FOUNDATIONAL contraction-model bug — FIXED (`8f0ecad`).**
    `a·(b·T)` (any ordinary double contraction, e.g. `v·(w·σ)`) canonicalized to
    the WRONG answer `(a·b)·T` — rank 0 silently became rank 2.  **Mechanism:**
    the nf model stores a contraction as a *flat left-fold chain*
    (`nf::Contraction{factors, ops}`), and `flatten_contraction` (`nf_lower.cpp`)
    dropped the bracketing via `flatten(l)++[op]++flatten(r)` — the "000057
    interface theorem".  Sound only for a genuine matrix chain; for a **fan-in /
    right-nesting into a rank-≥2 operand**, `Dot(a, Dot(b,T))` flattened to
    `[a,b,T]` when the faithful chain is `[b,T,a]` (= `b·T·a` = `a_j b_i T_ij`).
    (This is *why* `∇·(∇·ε)` came out as `Δε`.)  **Fix:** replaced the flattener
    with leg-aware `flatten_chain` — it tracks, per sub-chain, whether the result
    exposes a free leg at each physical tip (`free_front`/`free_back`), and
    orients/reorders a `·`'s operands so the contracted legs meet.  Prefers the
    two transpose-free splices; only when a rank-≤1 sub-chain must be read
    backwards does it emit a whole-chain transpose (vector = its transpose,
    scalar orientation-free), so a matrix chain is never disturbed.  `:`/`··` and
    unknown-rank operands keep the naive concat (no rank-1 connector possible).
    Contained: single entry point, downstream flat-`Contraction` consumers
    unchanged.  Tests: `CanonicalizeNf.{RightNestedFanInKeepsLegTopology,
    RankTwoFanInInsertsTranspose}`, py `test_{right_nested_fan_in_stays_scalar,
    rank2_fan_in_inserts_transpose}`.  Verified `a·(b·T)==b·(T·a)≠b·(Tᵀ·a)`.

  - **(3a) — free-index ∂ aliasing (NOT transpose-specific) — FIXED (`26612fb`).**
    `∇·(∇·ε)` via `expand_nabla` aliased the two ∂-summation indices
    (`∂_i∂_j → ∂_i∂_i`), collapsing the double divergence (componentized:
    `∂_x∂_xε_xy + ∂_y∂_yε_xy` instead of `2∂_x∂_yε_xy`).  Probing the marks: ε
    carried two ∂-marks both with the SAME canonical link, while the frame
    vectors kept distinct indices.  **Root cause (not the Transpose — plain
    div-div hits it):** `partial` canonicalizes its *intermediate* result; during
    operator application Leibniz differentiates a subterm (`e_j·∂_jε`) whose outer
    frame vector `e_i` has not joined yet, so that subterm's index is still free.
    Canonicalizing there α-renames the *contracted* dummy to a canonical negative
    id; when `e_i` later joins and the whole term is re-canonicalized, the freed
    index collides onto the same canonical id.  **Fix:** `partial` gained a
    `canon` flag (default true for standalone diff — the chain-rule path needs the
    0/1 fold); `apply_operators` passes `canon=false` at both call sites,
    deferring all canonicalization to the single final `canon_tolerant` pass.
    Test `Chart.ExpandNablaDivDivKeepsIndicesDistinct`, py
    `test_expand_nabla_double_divergence_and_transpose`.

  - **(3c) — transposed grad-div rank inflation — FIXED (`5c6f9ef`).**  Surfaced
    once 3a landed: `(∇⊗(∇·ε))ᵀ` expanded to rank 3.  A transposed grad-div's
    Leibniz term `∂_i e_j = 0` leaves a zero *product* `(e_i ⊗ 0 ⊗ ∂_jε)ᵀ`
    (rank 3) that the `Transpose` fence hides from canonicalize, and
    `expand_nabla`'s own cleanup only dropped literal-0 *addends*, not zero
    products.  **Fix:** exposed `nf::fold_forced_zeros` (was file-local in
    nf_lower.cpp) — it collapses any node forced to 0 by a literal-0 operand,
    through ⊗/contraction/transpose fences, bottom-up — and use it as
    `expand_nabla`'s cleanup.  `(∇⊗(∇·ε))ᵀ` now rank 2 == `(grad(div ε))ᵀ`.
    Test `Chart.ExpandNablaTransposedGradDivKeepsRank`.

  With 3a/3b/3c fixed, `expand_nabla` now handles **all** the operator
  compositions the reassembly RHS needs — grad-div, div-grad (Δε), div-div,
  and their transposes — each verified componentwise against the M6 chart
  operators.  Suite: **785 C++ + 239 Python green.**

  **NEXT: the symbolic reduce→reassemble route (increments 3/4) is unblocked.**
  Build `reassemble_del` reading each ∂-index's role (free e→grad leg,
  δ→Laplacian, e·ε→divergence), driven on a directly-constructed reduced
  interior (substitution into the derived `id_axBxc`), verified against the
  increment-5 oracle.  Increment 3 still needs the transpose-cross helper
  `a×(c×B)ᵀ = −a×Bᵀ×c` (residual `e_k×e_j`; `id_axBxc` derives fine).

**Increment 1 — chart-free `Nabla` operator node.**
- `struct Nabla final {};` in `expr.hpp` (a rank-1 invariant operator atom, no
  children); add to the `Expr` variant; `make_nabla`.  Thread through the same
  sites `Deriv` touched (compiler-guided): `rewrite_tree`/`map_children` (leaf),
  `structural_eq` (all equal), `infer_rank` (→ 1), `is_component_valued` (false),
  `has_free_index_for` (false), `find_index_space` (skip), render (`\nabla`; and
  `Nabla·Nabla` → `\Delta`), `diff` (throw — expand first), and the nf layer
  (`nf::Nabla` positional factor: lower/raise/rank=1/compare/hash/egraph via the
  Atom path).  Extend `place_factors`' operator detection to include `Nabla`.
- grad/div/rot/Δ are `Nabla` with `⊗`/`·`/`×`/`·∇`.  `inc ε` = `nabla % (nabla %
  eps).transpose()` chart-free.  Tests: rank, render (`∇×(∇×ε)ᵀ`, `∇∇θ`, `Δθ`),
  canon keeps it positional/opaque.

**Increment 2 — free-index ∂ and `expand_nabla`.**
- Teach the abstract-index `DerivMark` (`link` = the `CountableIndex` id): a
  free-index differentiation that *stamps a mark* `link=i` on a field (∂_i ε) and
  gives 0 on a constant frame vector (WCS), rather than concrete `partial`.
- Summation detection (`summation.cpp`) counts a mark's `link` index as an
  occurrence, so `e_i` (frame vector with slot index i) and `∂_i ε` (mark
  link=i) contract; render shows `∂_i` with the index letter.
- `expand_nabla(chart, e)`: replace each `Nabla` with `e_i (1/h_i) ∂_i` — a fresh
  shared `CountableIndex` i, an indexed frame vector `e_i`, a free-index `∂_i` —
  then apply the operators (Step B machinery, free-index variant).  Verify `inc
  ε` expands to `e_i × (e_j × ∂_i∂_j ε)ᵀ` (i,j summed, ε abstract), and that its
  components match brute-force `inc ε`.

**Increment 3 — Phase-1 reduction (derive + apply identities).**
- Derive `id_axBxc` and the nested-cross helper (Q3 recipe above); self-check
  test.  Apply them (`apply_identity`) to the free-index interior → the 5-term
  form `θ(e_j⊗e_i − δ_ij I) + (e_i e_j··ε)I + δ_ij ε − e_j⊗(e_i·ε) −
  (e_i⊗e_j·ε)ᵀ`.  Verify components vs brute force.

**Increment 4 — Phase-2 reassembly (the heart).**
- New engine `reassemble_del(ctx, e)`: per additive term, find the ∂-marks,
  resolve each abstract index's partner, classify (free frame vector → grad leg;
  `δ_ij` with the other ∂ → Laplacian; ε-slot → divergence; both into ε → double
  divergence), and emit the `Nabla` composition on θ/ε.  The differential
  sibling of `basis.hpp::reassemble`.  Fold to `∇∇θ, Δθ, ∇∇··ε, Δε, ∇∇·ε,
  (∇∇·ε)ᵀ`; symmetrize the last pair to `2(∇∇·ε)ˢ`.  Verify the reassembled
  `inc ε` equals the known closed identity (build the RHS with `Nabla` operators;
  `algebraic_eq` after a common expansion, or componentwise).

**Increment 5 — showcase + cylindrical.**
- `examples/strain_compatibility.py`: the full pipeline `inc ε` (chart-free) →
  `expand_nabla` → apply → reduce → reassemble → closed identity, verified.  Then
  the cylindrical evaluation of the compatibility equations (the original task
  #26 endpoint).  Keep the notebook stripped.
