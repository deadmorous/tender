# 000050 Theorem catalog

A living catalog of **theorems** — invariant (direct-notation) identities the
system aims to *derive*, not assume.  Distinct from the axiom-level `Identity`
rules (vibe 000033): a theorem is proved by a derivation (expand into a basis,
manipulate at the coordinate/index level, fold back), and once proved it can be
reused.  We grow this list gradually; each entry tracks how far the machinery
can currently take it.

## Status legend

| mark | meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ Proven   | a verified derivation exists (a test), ideally with a worked example |
| 🟡 In reach | the geometric pipeline reduces it to an index-algebra expression, but *closing* it needs a capability still on the deferred list |

the vector invariant / trace.)

## Notes per theorem

### 1. `a × I = I × a` — ✅ Proven

The first invariant-level theorem proved end to end (vibe 000049 follow-ups).
Derivation: expand both sides in WCS, `distribute_contraction` to push the cross
over the identity dyad `I = Σ_m e_m ⊗ e^m`, `simplify_basis_cross` to turn each
`e_i × e_m` into `ε e^k`, then `canonicalize`.  Both sides reduce to the same
`Σ_i Σ_j Σ_k −ε_{kji} a_k e_j e_i`.  Closing it required, in order: the
contraction-over-⊗ distribution, ε's cyclic symmetry (already in
`canon_symmetry`), and canonical ordering of nested `ExplicitSum` binders
(Fubini).  Test: `BasisFeasibility.CrossWithIdentityCommutes`; Python:
`TestBasisSteps.test_cross_with_identity_commutes`.  Worked example:
`examples/cross_identity.{py,ipynb}`.

### 4. `vec(I) = 0` — ✅ Proven

The vector invariant (axial vector) of a symmetric tensor vanishes; the identity
is symmetric.  Through the basis `I = Σ_i e_i⊗e_i`, so `vec(I) = Σ_i e_i × e_i`,
and each `e_i × e_i = 0` by the antisymmetry of the cross product.  Derivation:
`expand_in_basis` → `expand_dyad_ops` (`vec(e_i⊗e_i) = e_i × e_i`) →
`simplify_basis_cross` (`→ ε_{iik} e_k`) → `unroll_sums` →
**`eval_eps_concrete`** (every term has a repeated index, so ε = 0) →
`fold_arithmetic` → `0`.  `eval_eps_concrete` (the concrete Levi-Civita
evaluator, sibling of `eval_delta_concrete`) was the missing piece.  Test:
`BasisFeasibility.VectorInvariantOfIdentityIsZero`.

### 5. `tr(I) = n` — ✅ Proven

Through the basis, `tr(I) = Σ_i e_i·e_i = Σ_i δ_ii = n` (3 in 3D); reached by the
same coordinate machinery (`expand_dyad_ops` `tr(e_i⊗e_i) = e_i·e_i`,
`simplify_basis_dot`, `unroll_sums`, `eval_delta_concrete`, `fold_arithmetic`).
The closely related `I:I = tr(I) = 3` runs through `expand_double_dot`.

### 2. bac-cab `a × (b × c) = b (a·c) − c (a·b)` — 🟡 In reach

The geometric half works: expand, `distribute_contraction`, two rounds of
`simplify_basis_cross`, `canonicalize` reduce `a × (b × c)` to the index form
`Σ −ε_{mli} ε_{mkj} a_l b_k c_j e_i` — a product of two Levi-Civita symbols
sharing the summed index `m`.  Closing it then needs two things still deferred:
(a) **ε-pair contraction inside a larger product** — `contract_eps_pair` exists
but matches only a bare `ε ⊗ ε`, not `ε ε · (coordinates) · e`; the e-graph +
identity library (`eps_delta_*`, vibe 000046) is the general route, not yet
wired to the basis steps / Python; (b) **δ-substitution** — collapsing the
resulting `δ_{ab} x_a → x_b` against the coordinates, the recognized
parametric-RHS gap (vibes 000033/000040).

### 3. cross-identity-cross `a × I × b = b ⊗ a − (a·b) I` — 🟡 In reach

Same shape as bac-cab: the cross/identity-dyad pipeline reduces it to an ε-ε
index expression; closing needs the same ε-pair-in-product contraction and
δ-substitution.

## The shared blockers (what unlocks the 🟡 rows)

Two deferred capabilities recur and would convert the in-reach theorems to
proven:

- **δ-substitution** as a first-class step/rule: `Σ_p δ^{p}_{a} f(p,…) → f(a,…)`
  — needs a parametric slot + computed RHS (vibe 000033 §6, 000040).  Today it is
  worked around per-case with a data `Identity` (as in the `(e_i×e_j)·e_k = ε_ijk`
  example) or the concrete-unroll path.
- **ε-pair contraction within a product**: applying `eps_delta_*` to an `ε ⊗ ε`
  buried in a polyad of coordinates, via the e-graph saturator — exposing the
  identity library to the basis workflow (and to Python).

Once these land, #2 and #3 (and most cross-product vector identities) follow the
same expand → simplify_basis_cross → ε-δ → δ-substitution → reassemble arc.

## Next

Add theorems as the infrastructure grows; each proven theorem gets a test and,
where instructive, a maintained example.  Candidates after the δ-substitution /
ε-pair work: `tr(I) = n`, `I · a = a` (already a step), Binet–Cauchy, the
scalar/vector triple-product identities, and the differential-operator theorems
of Stage 5.
